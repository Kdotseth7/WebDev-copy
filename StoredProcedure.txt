		STORED PROCEDURE:-
		
		CREATE PROCEDURE spGetEmployees
		AS
		BEGIN
		  Select Name, Gender from tblEmployee
		END


		
		Note: When naming user defined stored procedures, Microsoft recommends not to use "sp_" as a prefix. 
			  All system stored procedures, are prefixed with "sp_".
			  This avoids any ambiguity between user defined and system stored procedures and any conflicts, with some future system procedure.
			  
	
		TO EXECUTE THE STORED PROCEDURE:-
		
		1. Highlight - spGetEmployees - and Execute
		2. EXEC spGetEmployees
		3. Execute spGetEmployees
		4. Right click on the procedure name, in object explorer in SQL Server Management Studio and select EXECUTE STORED PROCEDURE
		
		
		CREATING A STORED PROCEDURE WITH INPUT PARAMETERS:-
		
		This SP, accepts GENDER and DEPARTMENTID parameters. Parameters and variables have an @ prefix in their name.

		CREATE PROCEDURE spGetEmployeesByGenderAndDepartment 
		@Gender nvarchar(50),
		@DepartmentId int
		AS
		BEGIN
		  Select Name, Gender from tblEmployee Where Gender = @Gender and DepartmentId = @DepartmentId
		END

		To invoke this procedure, we need to pass the value for @Gender and @DepartmentId parameters.
		If you don't specify the name of the parameters, you have to first pass value for @Gender parameter and then for @DepartmentId.
		
		EXECUTE spGetEmployeesByGenderAndDepartment 'Male', 1

		On the other hand, if you change the order, you will get an error stating "Error converting data type varchar to int." SolN:-
		
		EXECUTE spGetEmployeesByGenderAndDepartment @DepartmentId=1, @Gender = 'Male'
		
		
		TO ENCRYPT THE TEXT OF THE SP:-
		
		ALTER PROCEDURE spGetEmployeesByGenderAndDepartment 
		@Gender nvarchar(50),
		@DepartmentId int
		WITH ENCRYPTION
		AS
		BEGIN
		  Select Name, Gender from tblEmployee Where Gender = @Gender and DepartmentId = @DepartmentId
		END
		
		TO CREATE AN SP WITH OUTPUT PARAMETER:-
		
		We use the keywords OUT or OUTPUT. @EmployeeCount is an OUTPUT parameter. Notice, it is specified with OUTPUT keyword. 
		
		CREATE PROCEDURE spGetEmployeeCountByGender
		@Gender nvarchar(20),
		@EmployeeCount int Output
		AS
		BEGIN
		 Select @EmployeeCount = COUNT(Id) 
		 from tblEmployee 
		 where Gender = @Gender
		END 
		
		To execute this stored procedure with OUTPUT parameter

		Declare @EmployeeTotal int
		Execute spGetEmployeeCountByGender 'Female', @EmployeeTotal output
		Print @EmployeeTotal
